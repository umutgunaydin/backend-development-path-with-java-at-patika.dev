# Problem:
* We write a program that finds whether a number is an armstrong number with Java loops.

## What is Armstrong Number?
* An n-digit number is called an Armstrong number if the sum of the nth powers of the digits is equal to the number itself.

### For example;
* Let's take the number 407. (4^3)+ (0^3)+(7^3) = 64+0+343 = 407. This shows that the number 407 is an armstrong number.

* Let's also look at the number 1342. (1^4)+(3^4)+(4^4)+(2^4) =1+81+256+16=354 is not an armstrong number because it is not equal to 1342.
