# Problem: Java Subarray(HackerRank)
###  We define the following:
*  A subarray of an n element array is an array composed from a contiguous block of the original array's elements. 
* For example, if array=[1,2,3], then the subarrays are [1],[2],[3],[1,2],[2,3], and [1,2,3]. 
* Something like [1,3] would not be a subarray as it's not a contiguous subsection of the original array.
*  The sum of an array is the total sum of its elements.
*  An array's sum is negative if the total sum of its elements is negative.
*  An array's sum is positive if the total sum of its elements is positive.
*  Given an array of n integers, find and print its number of negative subarrays on a new line.

### Input Format:
*The first line contains a single integer, n, denoting the length of array A=[a0,a1,a2,a3,a4..].
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing each respective element, a, in array A.

### Output Format:
* Print the number of subarrays of  having negative sums.
